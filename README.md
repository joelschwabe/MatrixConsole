# MatrixConsole
Matrix Console in HTML/CSS with jQuery

Everything is internal, just run the page in a modern browser.
It works in Chrome, IE, and Opera, but has troubles in Firefox. You tell me why, I don't know.

This is obviously not the most efficient way to have this made, C would have been a better choice I'm sure.
It's mostly just for playing around with jQuery.
